IWKids is an app designed to enhance the Emergency Room (ER) experience for children, parents, and healthcare staff. It was developed for the [Youth AI Pitch Competition](https://www.smu.ca/ai-summit/may3.html) at the Atlantic AI Summit 2025, hosted by Saint Mary's University (SMU) on May 3, 2025. The competition challenged teams to propose AI-driven solutions to improve the ER experience at the [IWK Hospital](https://iwkhealth.ca/), with judging criteria based on creativity, practicality, impact, and clarity of presentation. The concept for IWKids was developed by the [Bay View High School Tech Club](https://bvh-tech-club.netlify.app/), where I led the app development. The app was developed using [Expo](https://expo.dev/), a framework that streamlines the creation and deployment of [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) apps. It features an integration with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to power a medical diagnostic platform capable of providing preliminary diagnoses, and leverages [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to enable the transmission of SMS text messages for communication and notifications to families. After advancing through the initial qualifying round, we made it to the final round alongside seven other teams and proudly secured second place, earning a $500 prize. The experience was eye-opening for all of us, offering valuable insights into innovation in healthcare and the importance of collaborative, human-centered design in tackling real-world problems using AI.

## Why the ER is Scary for Kids and Parents

- Long wait times
- Confusing procedures
- Overwhelmed parents
- Busy staff can’t give 1:1 attention
- Kids pick up on adult emotions, stressed parents result in overwhelmed kids
